# What is Slidev?

Slidev or we can pronounce it (slide + dev, /slʌɪdɪv/) is a web-based slides maker and presenter. It's designed for developers to focus on writing content in Markdown while also having the power of HTML and Vue components to deliver pixel-perfect layouts and designs with embedded interactive demos in your presentations.

Slidev consist of the following features

- 📝 **Text-based** - focus on the content with Markdown, and then style them later
- 🎨 **Themable** - theme can be shared and used with npm packages
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Friendly** - code highlighting, live coding with autocompletion
- 🤹 **Interactive** - embedding Vue components to enhance your expressions
- 🎥 **Recording** - built-in recording and camera view
- 📤 **Portable** - export into PDF, PNGs, or even a hostable SPA
- 🛠 **Hackable** - anything possible on a webpage
